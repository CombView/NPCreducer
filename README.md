# NPCreducer
## NP-Complete reductions in CombView API

NP-Complete problems are of major importance in science and are strongly connected to the Millenium question: is P = NP?

This open-source MIT project intends to collect a vast number of NP-Complete reductions, 
representing problems in CombView language (proposed in 2017 by Igor & Vitor Coelho).

A basic CombView API for most used languages such as C/C++/Python/Java will be provided, 
in order to bind reducing functions to the internals of CombView language.

You are welcome to contribute! The folder models will give examples of problems and folder reductions
include NPCreducer functions in many languages.
